# Daily Planner

I wanted to create an application where I could focus only on my daily activities. Also figure somekind of "activity suggestion algorithm" where the application would suggest to fill the calendar everytime I got some free space on it.

Those activity suggestions could be related with "Goals". Those could be anything going from professional to personal activities. Things like "Studying 10 hours a week", or "Going to the movies once a month", etc.
